**Step 6:** Rate the podcast by selecting 1 to 5 stars. If you enjoy the podcast then please consider a **5 star rating**.

**Step 7:** Write a brief and honest review that is around one to three sentences.

**Thank you!**

Thanks for taking the time to review the Bitcoin Knowledge Podcast. It means a lot to me and to the show. Just like with books, higher ratings means greater discoverability so there will be a larger audience.

But &#8230; unlike book reviews, it can take several days for reviews to appear on iTunes. So do not be alarmed if yours does not show up immediately.

But do keep listening to the podcast so you can hear me thank you for your review. And please tell any friends about the podcast who may be interested in it.
